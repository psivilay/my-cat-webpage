# The Cat App

#### A website for cool cats and their favorite things, 10/28/16

#### By _**Peter Sivilay**_

## Description

_This webpage is designed for cool cats and to help their interests be known and also to support their incessant need for new toys, via Amazon._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Purr_
* _Be Lazy_
* _Throw up for no reason_
* _Waste litter by kicking it up and still not cover your own fecal matter_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_No known bugs, because if there, the cats would totally be pouncing around for them_

## Support and contact details

_Any issues, please feel free to contact our primary benefactor, Garfield. Yes that one._

## Technologies Used

_This is pretty basic html, using some block elements, inline elements, some picture and website linking._
